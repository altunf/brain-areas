    "title": "Brainteract: A New Way to Explore the Brain and Nervous System",
    "description1": "Brainteract is an interactive 3D platform designed to provide a deeper understanding of the brain and nervous system. Through realistic models and detailed explanations, it aims to make theoretical knowledge more accessible by visualizing complex structures. With Brainteract, you can explore brain lobes, neurons, and neural networks in detail, clicking on each region to access relevant scientific information.",
    "description2": "This platform serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in neuroscience. By interacting with Brainteract, you can discover how the brain functions, understand how neurons communicate, and closely examine the structure of the nervous system. Our goal is to make neuroscience more accessible by offering an open environment for both learning and exploration.",
    "developer": "Brainteract was developed by psychologist Fırat Altun.",
    "development": "This project is still under development, so you may encounter some errors. Your feedback is valuable to us!",
